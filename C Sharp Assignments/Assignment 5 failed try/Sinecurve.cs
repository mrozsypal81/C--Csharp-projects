//Background.  It is nearly impossible to program an animated object to move with true constant linear velocity.  If an object 
//is programmed to move in the path of a certain curve such as say y = tan(x) and no special provision is made for attaining 
//constant speed then the object will move faster when the tangent line has a steep slope and will move slower when the tangent
//line has a near horizontal slope.  The solution implemented in this program is to adjust the speed of the moving object by
//taking into account the slope of the tangent line.  

//Consider the mathematical function: f(t) = A*sin(B*t) where A is amplitude, and B is a coefficient related to the period of sine 
//via the identity period P = 2*Ï€/B.
//The derivative is f'(t) = A*B*cos(B*t)
//The corresponding 2-dim vector-valued function is P(t) = (t,f(t)) with derivative P'(t) = (1,f'(t)).
//The magnitude of the derivative indicates speed: |P'(t)| = sqrt(1+f'(t)^2) = sqrt(1+A^2*B^2*cos(B*t)^2)
//In the method get_next_coordinates the magnitude of the derivative will be used to moderate the speed of the dot.
//This is not a mathematical formula for "perfect" constant linear speed, but empirical testing shows that the technique produces 
//a highly accurate approximation of constant linear speed.
